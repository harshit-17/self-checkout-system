- Handling of fraudulent cases efficiently.
    - Unscanned items added in the trolley are detected.
    - Unscanned items removed from the trolley are detected.
    - Scanning item A but putting item B instead of A is detected for unequal weights of A and B.
- Real-time bill generation.
- Implementation of online payment options.
